This is a terraform to deploy an example of a scala glue job to convert a csv file to a parquet file.

The scala code is for a specific csv you can download it here : https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3
If you want to adapt it for your csv just change the mapping.

To deploy this project follow this commands:

terraform init -backend-config=backend/backend.config
terraform plan -var-file=tfvars/example_glue.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=tfvars/example_glue.tfvars

To destroy the resources use : terraform destroy -var-fil=tfvars/example_glue.tfvars


## Setting for the project

First modify the backend.config and the tfvars files.

You should after import the csv file in an S3.
Once you have done that just launch the crawler to generate a table.

Get the table name in you glue console and modify the scala variable table_name.
Load your scala to an S3 and specify the path in the tfvars.
Launch the job and it'll generate you a parquet file.

Once you got it you can check if you have the same numbers of raw for each file.
Create a crawler for your parquet file and check it.
